Welcome to my Data Structure and Algorithm portfolio! I am Michael Johan Gregorio, a skilled and 
cooperative web developer-to-be, with a striving passion for creating aesthetically pleasing, and 
at the same time, effective, and responsive sites. I have developed some projects that would surely 
show the range of my skills from calculators to string converters.
